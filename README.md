# 📊 Power BI Project Portfolio – Interactive Dashboards & Business Insights

Welcome to my Power BI Portfolio, where I showcase data storytelling and analytics projects designed to convert raw data into actionable insights. Each dashboard is built using real or realistic datasets and demonstrates advanced capabilities in DAX, data modeling, Power Query, and time intelligence.

I strongly believe that **learning never stops**—each project here is not only a demonstration of my skills but also a reflection of my curiosity, continuous improvement, and drive to solve real-world problems with data.
